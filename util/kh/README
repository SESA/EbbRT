Kittyhawk for SESA acts as a utility layer for the management of virtual
nodes. The scripts within contain the logic to allocate and deallocate virtual
machines (qemu+kvm) and store thier information in a local database.

khclean - end active applications / delete entire utility database
khctl - interfaces for managing kh
khdo - issue commands to a console
khget - allocate a node to an application
khls - list active applications
khrm - remove an active application
setup - set up an EbbRT build testbed, a new khdb and some helper scripts

## Usage
Run setup script from the directory you want to setup the build environment 
`mkdir ~/sesa/build  
cd ~/sesa/build`
First argument of setup is the full path to the root EbbRT source directory 
~/sesa/EbbRT/util/kh/setup ~/sesa/EbbRT

Load environment variables, enabling khls, khrm, etc
`source loadenv`
