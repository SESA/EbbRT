Kittyhawk for SESA acts as a utility layer for the management of virtual
nodes. The scripts within contain the logic to allocate and deallocate virtual
machines (qemu+kvm) and store thier information in a local database.

khclean - end active applications / delete entire utility database
khcon - connect to a nodes console
khctl - interfaces for managing kittyhawk layer
khget - allocate a node to an application
khls - list active applications
khrm - remove an active application
khvnc - connect to a nodes vnc server

## Setup (optional)
Set up an EbbRT build testbed, creates a new kh database,
includes helper scripts to make/run EbbRT apps
### usage
* Run setup script from the directory you want to setup the build environment 
`mkdir ~/sesa/build  
cd ~/sesa/build`
* First argument of setup is the full path to the EbbRT source directory 
`~/sesa/EbbRT/util/kh/setup ~/sesa/EbbRT`
* Load environment variables, enabling khls, khrm, etc
`source loadenv`
