This a slight rejiggering of the khmonitor for our current ebbrt version of kh
that allows us to visualize the state of the nodes and their dynamic changes.

In theory to run it you need to give execute the main bash script via its full path
and pass it two parameters 1) LOCAL and 2) the full path of of your khdb

so after establishing your khdb via khget/khctl you should be able to 
do something like:

jappavoo@kd-sesa:~/Work/EbbRT/util$ $PWD/bin/khmon LOCAL ~/Work/EbbRT/khdb
